# testdex

A simple DEX in Elrond network. University master's degree final project (cybersecurity/UOC).
Directories:

## contracts

In this directory you'll find the smart contracts. There is only one called TestDEX (testdex.rs).

## dapp

Containing the dApp implemented using TypeScrypt and React. The dApp is based on https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/dapp-template (by The Elrond Team). If a file is very similar to this source I'll add a comment at the beginning of the source code.

## latex

The latex files with the main document (language catalan).

If you get this error "I couldn't open style file IEEEtran.bst":
```
sudo apt install texlive-publishers
```
